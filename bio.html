        <p>My name is Bernard and I grew up in a suburb of Houston but now live in Austin. I am a beginner to coding but I'm very excited to learn so that I am able to build and create my own projects. Throughout my life I've always enjoyed hobbies that involve creation or tinkering, such as RC cars, building computers, or working on cars. Coding presents the same sort of appeal because you are putting together a website from scratch, in whatever style you choose. I am looking forward to learning more!</p>
